To collect all info&and;media on CCP with
 webbot into one source executable app.etc
.Place to bring all media types together
.Including all file types.

Put simply an automated search & information
 collection program of CCP info from all web sources.

To then make available streamlined info depending
On media file type required in order of priority.

World location of media file source
Location of source data server
Specific media sources BBC,ABC,SKY,Reuters,Youtube etc.
Any specific words to be Cross matched within
Other search types(maybe looking to hashtags,google search
Or wikipedia search)
Streamlined approach similar to google search but
To include many more filters&web servers.data
So called secure or otherwise.
And preferably apart from keyword search the
User definable filters to be located with a drop
Down menu GUI.to enable the lay person(joeshmo)
To be able to understand how powerful the tool can be&how
Easy it is to use.
Once setup for latest&oldest data on ccp specifically
Can be used in a wider sense to search all media news
&web based data etc.But still with a more window
Based GUI.I.E.to have previewaninated gifs on all media
Sources so aswell as mp4etc preview.an animated
Gif for txt based materials,or auto mp3 soundclip
For mp3's and other streamed sources etc.
Open to all input,although i will have final say
On end product commit&implementation.
Each individual commit/user input into project
Will be suitably renumerated as and when the project
Reaches a marketable size&scale.
Also pentesting & evolution would be grown organically
During project & compensations applied where
Applicable.i.e.when a pentest finds a breach &reports
It before it is common knowledge.
All msgs&commits can be seen on github&slack to
Help strealine&speedup developement.
